We collect the slugs from Maurices garden and Lulebells pear orchard and put them in the kitchen cooler. Sliced apples or pears on oven fresh buttermilk sourdough (thick cuts!) slathered in fresh Vermont butter from the creamer. Then we add the onion sauteed lightly salted slugs. No one has finished the sandwich entirely. Btw: slugs are poisonous to humans, even when cooked.",
